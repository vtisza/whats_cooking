# Whats Cooking

**Shiny/R** application based on the "What's cooking?" Kaggle machine learning challenge. User can input ingredients from a receipe and the app will predict the cuisine. It will also represent in a wordcloud the main ingredients of the predicted cuisine. After preprocessing ingredients are represented as a TF-IDF vector and a random forest was trained for the predictive algorithm. <br><br>For the deployed version of the app [click here](https://cooking.shinyapps.io/Predictor/).
